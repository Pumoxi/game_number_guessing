# Number Guessing Game üé≤  

A simple and interactive Python CLI game where you guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Test your luck and logic with two levels of difficulty!  

---

## Features  
- **Difficulty Modes**:  
  - Easy: 10 attempts  
  - Hard: 5 attempts  
- Provides feedback ("Too high" or "Too low") after each guess.  
- Declares a win or loss based on the number of attempts left.  

---

## How It Works  

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. You choose a difficulty level: **easy** (10 attempts) or **hard** (5 attempts).  
3. Start guessing!  
   - If your guess is too high or too low, you'll receive feedback to guide your next guess.  
   - You win if you guess correctly within the allowed attempts.  
   - If you run out of attempts, the game ends with a loss.

4. Sample Gameplay

    ```plaintext
    Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!  
    I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.  

    Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy  
    You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.  
    Make a guess: 50  
    Too low.  
    Guess again.  

    You have 9 attempts remaining to guess the number.  
    Make a guess: 75  
    Too high.  
    Guess again.  

    You have 8 attempts remaining to guess the number.  
    Make a guess: 63  
    You got it! The answer was 63.  
    ```

## Customization

You can easily modify the game by updating the following variables in the code:
	‚Ä¢	EASY_ATTEMPTS for the number of attempts in easy mode.
	‚Ä¢	HARD_ATTEMPTS for the number of attempts in hard mode.
